863633 - Culling and clipping is missing 
863632 - Initialization for multiple processes 
863631 - Mipmapping still needs to be implemented 
863640 - Depth coordinate now handled correctly
863652 - Enhance performanced impact for stencil buffer on pipeline 


Version 0.1
-----------

This is an initial release of the compiled library. Known issues logged into the bug database.
