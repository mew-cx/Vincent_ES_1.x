Release Notes
=============

This document collects changes on a release to release base. For open known issues, please refer to
the bug database on sourceforge. 


Version 0.82
------------

This version addresses the following issues:

1010509 - specular exponent in material not initialized


Version 0.81
------------

This version adds the redbook examples that are distributed with the reference implementation. To
do so, a version of the gu library (the mini GLUT included in the reference implementation) has
been added.

In addition, a couple of defects that showed up in those examples have been addressed:

 863654  - Create specialized pipeline functions for geometry stage 
 960543 - BindTexture should record an error for invalid targets
1001348 - By default, smooth shading should be enabled
1001352 - movelight example is rendered incorrectly
1001351 - alpha3d example does not render correctly
1001354 - Stray red pixels in examples
1001356 - Polyoff example shows stippling
1008798 - Clipping issue invovling points at infinity
1001825 - Mesh created by ugWireSphere/ugSolidSphere is iffy
1001882	- eglGetError return value


Version 0.80
------------

This version constitutes a major milestone for Vincent. First of all, Vincent has become
feature complete and can pass the full OpenGL ES conformance test in internal runs. From this
point on, all releases of Vincent will be fully regression tested against the conformance
test.

Second, first steps towards support for Symbian has been added; specifically support for implementations
of Nokia's Series 60 platform. The implementations is not fully working yet, but at least will compile
without errors. If you are interested in completing this port, please contact the project administrator.

This version addresses the following issues:

980877 - Mipmaps Selection test failed.
980878 - Mipmaps Interpolation test failed.
996378 - Color buffer is effectively 16-bit
996379 - Trap exceptions when context not set.
997772 - compressed NULL texture fails.

Notes:

1.) Even though this build passes the mipmap interpolation test from the conformance test, tri-linear
mipmapping is still not implemented yet. This should become available soon.

2.) Users of previous builds of this library will notice a substantial reduction in performance (~15%)
compared to previous builds when using mipmapping. This is due to the fact that the current build will
perform mipmap selection on a per-pixel base; more precisely, per linearly interpolated sub-span of
each scan line. The plan is to introduce several configurations, which will be either fully-conformant
but slower, or not fully conformant but faster.

3.) While the current build passes the conformance test, the current build still uses different
rendering paths for point and line rasterization (non-JIT) than for triangle rasterization (JIT). The
upcoming series of builds will convert point and line rasterization to use the JIT. Besides increased
performance especially for rendering lines the most significant gain will be a reliable assessment of
the correctness of this implementation by using a single path for all raster operations.


Version 0.79
------------

This build features a new rasterizer for triangles. Most notably, the new rasterizer fully
implements the plane equation approach with pixel and texel correct stepping of all
parameters.

To fully pass the conformance test, the base internal format for RGBA textures has been changed from
RGBA5551 to RGBA8888. The base internal format can easily be set to the other supported formats by
changing the return value of TextureFormatFromEnum in ContextTexture.cpp.

The remaining issues with the conformance test are regardng mipmap selection and mipmap interpolation.
Currently, Vincent uses mipmap selection on a per-triangle base as is common for most rasterizers.
For those two remaining tests, mipmap selection will have to be done on a per-pixel base based
on the current texture gradients. The plan is to create two EGL Config entries, one marked as
slow (but conformant and using per pixel mipmap selection), the other being marked as non-conformant 
(and using per-triangle mip mapping).

This version addresses the following issues:

961343 - Use DDA for triangle edges
970915 - Matrix Stack test failed
980874 - Texture Edge Clamp test failed.
970910 - Triangle Tile test failed.
980879 - Packed Pixels test failed.
980882 - Copy Texture test failed. For this issue, there still needs to be a clarification 
	 from the review board concerning the minimum bit depth required for textures.
980876 - Compressed Paletted Texture test failed.	 
987381 - Line clipper bug.


Version 0.78
------------

texture sampling. Notably, it passes the lightning, fog and blending tests.

This version addresses the following issues:

970897 - Vertex Order test (Test number #5) failed.
970910 - Triangle Tile test failed
970911 - Spotlight tests failed
970912 - Blend test failed.
970913 - Fog Linear test failed.

Key changes in this version of the library are tracked under the following tracker numbers:

958793 - Create math library for non-XScale processors
937679 - Employ plane equations for rasterization

In addition, this version addresses the following issues:

960542 - fragment processing for clearing missing/incorrect
960937 - Pixel ownership test not implemented correctly
958787 - GL_OES_query_matrix extension missing
951114 - glLineWidth causes freeze
958791 - eglCopyBuffers not implemented
958797 - eglGetProcAddress not implemented
958790 - Pixmap rendering surface not implemented


Version 0.75 (beta)
-------------------

Vincent goes finally beta. The library is becoming sufficiently stable that I feel
comfortable to advertise it to a larger user base. In addition, Vincent successfuly
runs on Pocket PCs having StrongARM processors and Smartphones using TI OMAP processors.

For the next point release, the plan is to rework the rasterizer to employ more of the
ideas outlined in Hecker's artcile series on software rasterization (see link on web site).
Also, now that a sufficiently sized set of regression tests is passed, I can finally
address the overall performance issues that the library has. Especially the JIT has
a huge performance potential once instruction re-ordering (both IR and on machine code 
level) get incorporated. I just did not want to re-order instructions unless in-order
execution was correct.

I have been using the core parts of the OpenGL ES test suite to ensure a controlled level
of quality for this release. I am excercising only the fixed point API as part of these
tests. Note that these are internal runs executed on a Pocket PC with XScale porocessor. 
There has not been an official submission of any tests results yet, and I do not claim
any level of compliance with the OpenGL ES 1.0 API specification.
