Simple and incomplete windowing library for simple demo programs.
X11-windowing version mostly complete, WIN32 unstarted.

Shape-library needs fixed-point versions of functions.

redbook_2ed contains ports of relevent example programs.  Programs
are floating-point only, so they need the Common Profile library
- libGLES_CM.{a.so}.
