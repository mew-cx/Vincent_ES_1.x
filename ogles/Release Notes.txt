Version 0.75 (beta)
-------------------

Vincent goes finally beta. The library is becoming sufficiently stable that I feel
comfortable to advertise it to a larger user base. In addition, Vincent successfuly
runs on Pocket PCs having StrongARM processors and Smartphones using TI OMAP processors.

For the next point release, the plan is to rework the rasterizer to employ more of the
ideas outlined in Hecker's artcile series on software rasterization (see link on web site).
Also, now that a sufficiently sized set of regression tests is passed, I can finally
address the overall performance issues that the library has. Especially the JIT has
a huge performance potential once instruction re-ordering (both IR and on machine code 
level) get incorporated. I just did not want to re-order instructions unless in-order
execution was correct.

I have been using the core parts of the OpenGL ES test suite to ensure a controlled level
of quality for this release. I am excercising only the fixed point API as part of these
tests. Note that these are internal runs executed on a Pocket PC with XScale porocessor. 
There has not been an official submission of any tests results yet, and I do not claim
any level of compliance with the OpenGL ES 1.0 API specification.
